PLUGANDPLAY-Controller-Code
===========================

Here is the code I used for the PLUGANDPLAY MIDI Controller.  This code was taken and compressed from the instructable: http://www.instructables.com/id/Arcade-Button-MIDI-Controller/ . 
Originally, I attempted to use the HIDUINO custom firmware for Arduino.  After many attempts and much troubleshooting I was unable to boot load the HIDUINO firmware to my Arduino R3, as the firmware is currently designed for the Arduino SMD (alternatively, a modification can be made to an Arduino uno R2 or earlier model that will enable the same properties as and Arduino SMD)
Due to this incompatability, I decided to continue to follow the previously mentioned instructable and use a Serial to MIDI converter.
All code, plugins, and mapping used for this project will be posted here.
